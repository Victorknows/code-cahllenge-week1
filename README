**CODE CHALLEGE**

**LEARNING GOALS**

- **Student Grade Generator**
- **Create a speed detector**
- **Create a Net Salary Calculator**

**DESCRIPTION**

This repository contains phase 1 week1 code challenge. You are supposed to solve the problems using JavaScript.

**CHALLENGE 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)**

Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond to the correct grade, as shown below:

- A > 79
- B - 60 to 79
- C - 59 to 49
- D - 40 to 49
- E - less than 40

**CHALLENGE 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)**

Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input (e.g., 80). If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

**CHALLENGE 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)**

Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e., Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary.

**REQUIREMENTS**

For the building and running of this program, you will require the following:

- Web browser.
